# nznewspapers

This project creates The Newspapers of New Zealand website, an index to all the newspapers ever published in New Zealand. 

The website is available at https://nznewspapers.github.io/nznewspapers/

## About the website

Note this is a new version of an older website that dropped off the internet in 2020. Luckily, it is archived in the Wayback Machine (thanks Internet Archive): https://web.archive.org/web/20200710010513/http://nznewspapers.appspot.com/


This version os the site uses GitHub to manage the data (in JSON files), build the website (using HTML, CSS and Javascript), and publish the site (in GitHub pages). The code has been developed partly as a teaching exercise, so is nice and simple. Please feel free to contribute.
