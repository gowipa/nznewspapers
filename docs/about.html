        <h3>About this title</h3>
        <p>
          <a href="/">Newspapers of New Zealand</a> is a catalogue of all the
          newspapers that have been published in New Zealand since the
          <a href="newspaper.html?id=2069"
            >New Zealand Gazette and Wellington Spectator</a
          >
          in 1839.
        </p>

        <h3>Scope</h3>
        <p>
          Our definition of newspapers includes serial publications that are
          published in New Zealand for a general audience, and takes into
          account their frequency, appearance, and content.
        </p>

        <h3>Sources</h3>
        <p>
          The data in this website is based on a subset of the New Zealand
          National Bibliography. It was tidied up and annotated with references
          to online sources when possible (both manually and automatically) and
          published as the original
