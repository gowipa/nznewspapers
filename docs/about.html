          <h3>About this title</h3>

          <p><a href="/">Newspapers of New Zealand</a> is a catalogue of all the newspapers 
            that have been published in New Zealand since 
            the <a href="newspaper.html?id=2069">New Zealand Gazette and Wellington Spectator</a> in 1839.</a>
          </p>

          <h3>Scope</h3>
          <p>
            Our definition of newspapers includes serial publications that are published in New Zealand for a general audience, 
            and takes into account their frequency, appearance, and content.
          </p>

          <h3>Sources</h3>
          <p>
            The data in this website is based on a subset of the New Zealand National Bibliography. 
            It was tidied up and annotated with references to online sources when possible (both manually and automatically)
            and published as the original 
            <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200510114635/http://nznewspapers.appspot.com/about">Newspapers of New Zealand website</a> until it was taken down after Google retired some programs in 2020.
          </p>
          <p>
            The base data was from the Publications New Zealand Metadata Dataset created by 
            the <a href="http://www.natlib.govt.nz">National Library of New Zealand</a> 
            and licensed under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/nz/">Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 licence</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most recent refresh of the PublicationsNZ data was in March 2013.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the PublicationsNZ data is quite comprehensive, there are some omissions, inconsistencies, and even mistakes. These are tidied up as they are discovered.
          </p>
          <p>
            Generally, the data for older records (pre-1950) is pretty good, but some more recent records (particularly for free community newspapers) can be patchy.
          </p>
          <p>
            The newspaper records are being updated over time, and links to digital holdings added.
